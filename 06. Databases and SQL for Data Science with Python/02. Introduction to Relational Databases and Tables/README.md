Data is stored in tables. This provides logical data independence, physical data independence, and physical storage independence.

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
ER models are used as a tool to design relational databases. The building blocks of an ER diagram are **entities** and **attributes**.

Entities are drawn as rectangles, and attributes as ovals, as shown below.
