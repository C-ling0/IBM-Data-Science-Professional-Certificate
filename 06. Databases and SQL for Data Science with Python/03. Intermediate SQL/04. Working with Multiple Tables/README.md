# Working with Multiple Tables
There are 3 main ways of accessing multiple tables in the same query:
1. Sub-queries
2. Implicit `JOIN`
3. `JOIN` operators (`INNER JOIN`, `OUTER JOIN`, etc.)

The latter is covered in the following module: [Bonus Module - Advanced SQL for Data Engineering](https://github.com/DanielBarnes18/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/06.%20Databases%20and%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science%20with%20Python/06.%20Bonus%20Module%20-%20Advanced%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Engineering)
